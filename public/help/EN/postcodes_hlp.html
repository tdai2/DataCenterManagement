        <p>Previous and current boot POST codes are shown. The current boot codes become previous codes when the system is reset or shut down.</p>
        <p>Holding the cursor over a time, POST code, or description will highlight all other occurrences of that same POST code. Clicking on a time, POST code, or description will cause highlighting to persist until another code is clicked.</p>
